                Lowe's Home Improvement. Most everyone knows who the company is, I've only worked there for two years, but previously, I was a Lowe's Shopper for quite a few years, not really liking going to Home Depot, and plus, even when I was in New York, Lowe's was
                closer. But, in 2018 I applied for a call center position at the company, had a phone interview (right after a shift at the ABC store...) and then a few weeks later, was asked to visit corporate for an in person interview.

                As one would expect, my first visit to the corporate campus of Lowe's in Mooresville, NC was pretty intimidating. The campus itself is really pretty. If, after this whole nonsense with COVID-19 dies down, you ever get a chance to go visit, I highly reccomend
                it, at least to be able to go see the lake and the buildings. There's very interesting decor on campus, as one would expect from a company like Lowe's. However, if you're into NASCAR, it also might be worth visiting, because even though
                the company stopped sponsoring Jimmie Johnson in NASCAR, they didn't abandon that part of their history, and there's a section with all of the Championship trophies from Jimmie Johnson's career.

                I'm digressing again, what a surprise. Well, I got ready for this interview and ended up actually getting the position in the call center. At that point, the department wasn't explicitly a call center, the department was called "Central Quoting". It was
                here where I worked on a team building quotes for window treatments for about a year and learned a lot about blinds and shades. I eventually got offered a position for a lateral transfer onto the "Exceptions Team", where I quickly became
                the department's excel reporting guru. At this point in time I was also taking classes in Data Science from the UNCC Boot Camps.
            </p>
            <p>
                After finishing these classes at UNCC, it took some time, but I was applying for jobs left and right looking to jump to an Analyst position somewhere (hopefully at Lowe's). About six months after finishing the course and still working on my programming
                skills and continuing courses here at CPCC, I applied for my current role of a "Supplier Support Analyst", I didn't think much of it, because I applied in February, but the job posting never disappeared. Suddenly sometime in April, I got
                a notification that I got an interview for this position and it turns out that I got the job with a start date of June 1st. Since getting my position I've worked 100% remote and a large portion of my job is managing relationships with
                some vendors, my biggest vendor being Sherwin Williams. However, I have had the opportunity to use my knowledge of python and Data Science to analyze and compile data and reporting for my boss and I've also had opportunities to lead a
                large, high visibility project with some product management for the company. I love the position and am excited to have gotten the position, but I am also already planning for my next steps in the company and looking for career growth.
                Come next year, I expect to be working with my boss and looking at applying to other positions within the organization that better suit my skillset.
