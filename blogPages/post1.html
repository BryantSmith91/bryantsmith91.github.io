            <p>I touched on this on my "About me" page, but I am from New York and went to college in New York City prior to moving to North Carolina. At this point in my life, I was looking to be a police officer. That didn't happen, but that doesn't mean
                I don't look back fondly at my time at John Jay or say I made mistakes in my formative years.</p>

                While at John Jay, I took many classes in and majored in Criminology, eventually earning my Bachelors of Arts in Criminology. In the future, I'd love to know more about data science enough to be able to pursue a job opportunity where I can use my love
                of data science and my passion for criminology and helping people in the same career path, but I'm digressing. While at John Jay, I learned a lot and had a lot of exposure to police officers and was introduced to coding C++, while I didn't
                maintain my knowledge of C++ from back then, it was my intro to computer science. Why I didn't chose this career path back then, it was probably due to my limited mathematical skill set. So, realistically, my time at John Jay, I took a
                lot of classes enhancing my knowledge about criminology, psychology, sociology, and even a class all about White collar crime.
            </p>
            <p>
                I took a couple of general education classes as well, an english class I took towards my Junior year was all about comic books and graphic novels, it provided a really interesting insight to some very well known graphic novels and introduced me to others
                I never would've even thought of reading. I also took a gen-ed class about the history of weapons, while honestly, it was a very boring class where the professor (who wrote the book) basically read and taught the textbook for the class.
                The history of weaponry going back to spears all the way to modern weapons like the AK-47 is very insightful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking back, while I was at John Jay, I think I was going through an identity crisis in my life. I didn't honestly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I didn't really want to pursue being a police officer. I took a myriad of classes, basically trying
                to ensure I completed my degree, but not with any focus other than that and "Oh, this class sounds interesting, let's take it." It wasn't until well after I moved down to North Carolina, found my life-partner, and got gently nudged back
                onto the path of computer science by getting asked to complete a project in MS Access for my mother that I really discovered the path I would like to travel in my life. Now I know where I want to go next from my current job at Lowe's,
                who I want to spend the rest of my life with, and honestly, the company that I'd like to build a career with (given the chance).
            </p>
            <p>Was my time at John Jay a waste? No, definitely not! Did it help me get on the right path, I'm not entirely sure. But I can tell you one thing, I wouldn't be who or where I am today if I didn't spend those four years at John Jay, so if I had
                to decide all over again? I would do exactly the same thing.
